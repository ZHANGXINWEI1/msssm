## configuration file structure
# this file describes how a configuration file must look like

general
-------
<key> = <value>			Note that the spaces are needed!
floors are numbered from 1 to floor_count, 1 is the ground floor


config file
-----------

TODO: max speed, some randomness (panic factor ?), ...
	 simulation speed?


agents_per_floor = <agents>					number of agents per floor
agents_radius_min = <min_radius>
agents_radius_max = <max_radius>			radius of each agent in meters
											values are uniformaly distributed between
											min and max

width = <width>
height = <height>							simulation width & height (all
											images must have this dimension)
meter_per_pixel = <scale>					scaling to convert meters <--> pixels
											value in meters = pixels * meter_per_pixel


floor_count = <num of floors>
floor_<i>_build = some_image.png			building image for floor i
											i in [1,floor_count]
floor_<i>_soc_forces = some_image.png		social forces image for floor i



images
------
image format should be png, but can also be something else
image must have 3 channels (RGB) and 8 bits/channel

building image:
 how the building looks like and where the agents are
 - background (ignored)						white   #ffffff
 - walls 									black   #000000
 - agent spawning areas						pink    #ff00ff 
 - exits									green   #00ff00
 - stairs down								blue    #0000ff
 - stairs up								red		#ff0000
 stairs: for each down stairs spot (connected color) there must be an up stairs
 at the same spot on the floor below. this allows multiple stairs per floor.

social forces image:
 attractive/repulsive forces that act on the agents
 - gradient:
   black #000000 = maximal repulsive force
         #800000 = no force (neutral)
   white #ffffff = maximal attractive force
