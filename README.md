> * Group Name: Baby-chiefs
> * Group participants names: Felix Thaler, Hans Hardmeier, Beat Kueng, Andrin Jenal 
> * Project Title: Modelling Situations of Evacuation in a Multi-level Building

## General Introduction

Simulating the evacuation scenario of a 2D single-level building is well known but no general enough. Though we want to introduce a more sophisticated simulation within a multi-level building. 

E.g.: What would happen, if the ETH building has to be evacuated? Which escape routes would be mostly used?

Since skyscraper/tower building are getting more common in large cities, engineers have to care more about the behaviour in situations of emergency namenly evacuation. 

## The Model

We are planning to base our work on the social force model of Disaster spreading and pedestrian dynamics

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)
